    "# Improved Customer Support Ticket Classification Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This document details the process of training a machine learning model to classify customer support tickets using RoBERTa. The model is fine-tuned with class weights for imbalanced data, early stopping, and improved hyperparameters for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, feature engineering, and filtering based on tag distribution.\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**: RoBERTa model selected for its better performance on sequence classification tasks.\n",
    "3. **Fine-Tuning**: Improved fine-tuning approach with customized trainer, early stopping, and dynamic padding.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation with accuracy, F1 scores, and detailed classification report.\n",
    "5. **Inference**: Enhanced prediction function for real-time ticket classification with confidence scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Class Weighting**: Handles class imbalance with balanced class weights.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**: Monitors model's performance to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Padding**: Optimizes memory usage during tokenization.\n"
